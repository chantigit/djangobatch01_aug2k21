Session 4:
==========
Q1.How many ways we can use git client ?
Ans:
	1.windows command prompt	(Given by MS & DOS commands)
	2.git bash(CUI)			(Given by GitHub & unix commands)
	3.git gui(Drag & Drop)
	4.IDE's
		->Eclispe	
		->Spring Tool Suite

Working with git branches:
__________________________
1.git branch			: display all current branches
2.git branch <branchname>	: creating a new branch
3.git checkout <branchname>	: moving into a branch	(*)
4.git checkout -b <branchname>	: creating a new branch & moving into a branch	(*)
5.git merge <branchname>	: merging branches


Session 5:
==========
1.git branch -d <branchname>	:	Deleting branches
2.git commit -am "commit msg"	:	add + commit	(Work for only exisiting files)
3.rm Vs git rm			
4.git checkout  filename	:	undo file from working dir
5.mv Vs git mv		
6. .gitignore file use

Q1.	What files are by default not tracked by GIT ?
Ans:	empty folder,image,audio,video

Q2:	Can we make restrict to do not tracked few files by GIT?
Ans:	Yes,by creating .gitignore file


Session 6:
==========
Q1.Diff b/w merge & rebase ?


Session 7:
==========
Q1.How can delete a commmit change in our application ?

Ans:
	git	revert	SHA1

Q2.How can I roll back my previous 3 commits locally in a branch? In other words, how can 
I create a branch without my latest 3 commits (assume I have the SHA of that commit from git log)?

Ans:

git checkout -b new_branch SHA1

	{OR}

git checkout -b new_branch HEAD~3

Q3.What is stash ?

	Def:store (something) safely in a hidden or secret place which is used in future.
	1.Moving content into stash
		git stash save 'commit msg'
	Note:To know how many stashes are exist

		git stash list
	2.Getting content from stash

		1.copy +paste	=> git stash apply stashid
		
		2.cut + paste	=> git stash pop stashid

	3.Deleting stash area
		
		1.git stash drop stashid	(delete specific stash)

		2.git stash clear		(delete all stashes)



Q4.Deleting git tracks id ?

	git	reset	--soft	SHA1		(SHA1 is deleted from local dir)

	git	reset	--mixed	SHA1		(SHA1 is deleted from local+stage dir)

	git	reset	--hard	SHA1		(SHA1 is deleted from local+stage+working dir)



Q5.How Git is used from Eclispe ?

Ans:

Step1:TL create empty repo
Step2:TL open eclispe & created project structure then initialize to the above repo
Step3:Send repo invitation to all Team members
Step4:TM accept the invitation
Step5:TM clone the project from repo into working dir
Step6:TM create a project in eclispe by importing project from working dir
Step7:Add his work on that repo & do commit & push operations
